<H3>DEFINITION</H3>
<HR>
 A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation) automatically
<BR>Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs.<BR> These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

<H3>Concept of modern computer</H3>
<BR>
The principle of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing in his seminal 1936 paper,[57] On Computable Numbers. <BR>Turing proposed a simple device that he called "Universal Computing machine" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine. He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.[58] Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine.
